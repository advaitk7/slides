# Continuous Integration

<Notes>

The process of continuously testing/building/etc your code so that it is never in a broken state and is **always** deployable.

## Requirements for CI

<ul>
    <Appear>
        <li>Automated Setup/Containerization</li>
        <li>Testability</li>
        <li>Reproducibility</li>
    </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>

These are requirements for the project for which you intend to implement CI.

- Using things like [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/) to make your code portable and easier to run on any machine and/or environments, or using Infrastructure as Code tools like [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/quickstart.html) to setup systems in an automated way

- Your code should be testable in an automatic fashion. Could be unit tests, integration tests, api tests through Postman, or UI testing.

- Test results should be same in different environments and on repeat runs

There are also some implicit ones that aren't mentioned like a version control system (like Git), a Pull/Merge Request based check-in system.

# Tools of the Trade

- [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
- [Drone.io](https://drone.io/)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/devops/)
- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)
- [JetBrains TeamCity](https://jenkins.io/)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/)

<Notes>

Lots of options now. Big(Microsoft - Azure) & small (Drone.io) companies, SaaS (Azure), self-hosted(Jenkins), both (Drone) and mixed (Gitlab - SaaS mixed with self hosted runners).

There are also small niche tools that plug into your existing infra, eg. DangerJS (adding custom project specific checks), Relative-CI (for comparing bundle-sizes), CodeCov for coverage, CodeQuality, etc. These work alongside/through your option of choice above.
