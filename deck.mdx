# CI

#### <Tomato>Or how to automate the boring parts</Tomato>

<Notes>

Hello everyone! 

Today I'm going to talk about the CI part of CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery), or as how I like to call it, 'How to automate the boring parts'

<Notes>

First, a little about me. My name is Rohit Gohri, I am a Sr. Software Developer at CollegeDunia. 

I am a full stack developer with a keen interest in DevOps, I love optimising developer workflows and working on devloper tooling.

# What Is Continuous Integration?

</Small>

<Notes>

The process of continuously testing/building/etc your code as you **push** it so that problems get detected early, your main branch is never in a broken state and is **always** deployable.

</Notes>

---

# Why should you care?

<Notes>

- Single source of truth: No more "But it works on my machine"
- Enforce common rules for teams: Have a linting config? Have a codestyle? Want to enforce sepecific folder structures? Everything can be checked by the CI
- Faster/Better Code Reviews: Having the basic stuff automatically checked leaves the reviewer to focus on the code

</Notes>

## Prerequisites for <Tomato>CI</Tomato>

<ul>
    <Appear>
        <li>Automated Setup/Containerization</li>
        <li>Testability</li>
        <li>Reproducibility</li>
        <li><Tomato>Culture</Tomato></li>
    </Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>

There are some things that your project & team need to have before you start this journey.

- **Automated Setup**: Using things like [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/) to make your code portable and easier to run on any machine and/or environments, or using Infrastructure as Code tools like [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/quickstart.html) to setup systems in an automated way

- **Testability**: Your code should be testable in an automatic fashion. Could be unit tests, integration tests, api tests through Postman, or UI testing.

- **Reproducibility**: Test results should be same in different environments and on repeat runs

- **Culture**: All of this if useless if you or your team members don't follow the process all of you set for yourselves. A failing CI pipeline is useless if the branch gets merged anyway.

There are also some implicit ones that aren't mentioned like having a version control system (like Git), a Pull/Merge Request based check-in system, etc.

# Tools of the Trade

- [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
- [Drone.io](https://drone.io/)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/devops/)
- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)
- [JetBrains TeamCity](https://jenkins.io/)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/)
- .....

<Notes>

There are lots of options in the market now. 
- Size
  - Big (Microsoft - Azure) 
  - Small (Drone.io) 
- Model
  - SaaS (Azure)
  - Self-hosted(Jenkins)
  - Both (Drone, Gitlab)
  - Mixed: SaaS + Self Hosted Runners (Gitlab/Github).

A lot of them are also free for open source projects! So there is no excuse to not use these on your next personal project.

There are also small niche tools that plug into your existing infra, eg. DangerJS (adding custom project specific checks), Relative-CI (for comparing bundle-sizes), CodeCov for coverage, CodeClimate, etc. These work alongside/through your option of choice above.

# Pick One?

<Appear>

# Or All of them? üî•

</Appear>

<Notes>

So for the demo I have already set up a simple repository on Github with create-react-app.

I have also added yaml configs for various CI providers in one single repo. You can check how they are setup later.

# Demo

<div style={{display: 'flex'}}>
    <img src={QRCode} style={{width: '30vw'}}/>
    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
    <div style={{display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', fontSize: '32px'}}>
        github.com/rohit-smpx/hello-ci-frontend
    </div>
</div>

<Notes>

<Tomato>Send link to slack channel at this time</Tomato>

It would be great if you could take out your laptops and open the link:

- Fork the project
- Clone it
- Create and checkout to a new branch: `git checkout -b demo`
- Do `npm i` or `yarn`
- Start the website: `npm start` or `yarn start`

</Notes>

---

# Open a PR

- Make some changes
<!-- TODO: Ask to do some specific change or let them do whatever. Want to see a mix of failing and passing pipelines -->
- Commit and push your code
- Open the repository and Create a new PR
- Wait for results

<Notes>

Already have 2 PRs open already (one passing and one failing).
Wait for people to do this.

- Show some results
- one failing
- one passing
- different providers
- Lastly focus on Gitlab CI results to associate with next slide

</Notes>

# How did this happen?

Let's look at one example config (`.gitlab-ci.yml`)

---

<CodeSurfer theme={codeTheme} subtitle=".gitlab-ci.yml">

```yaml file=./.gitlab-ci.yml
```

```yaml 4,5 file=./.gitlab-ci.yml
```

```yaml 17:19 file=./.gitlab-ci.yml
```

```yaml 14,15 file=./.gitlab-ci.yml
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

It is written in YAML(most of these are). This file defines a pipeline that will be run whenever you push your code. Let's look at what each of these mean:

CodeSnippets:

1. This is the base (Docker) image on which each stage in the pipeline will run 
2. These are stages defined that we saw in the UI
3. This script runs before every job in the pipeline
